This code creates a graphical user interface (GUI) using the Tkinter library that allows the user to select an image file, display the selected image in the window, and analyze the image using the DeepFace library.

The DeepFace library is used to perform facial analysis on the selected image and extract information such as age, gender, race, and emotion. The results of the analysis are displayed in the GUI along with the selected image.

The purpose of this code is to provide a user-friendly tool for image analysis that can be used for various applications, such as social media monitoring, market research, and security systems.
